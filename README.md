# Property24_SQL_Data_Analysis
This project explores a large South African residential property dataset (~100,000 records) using SQL. The objective was to answer real-world business questions through structured SELECT queries, aggregations, filtering, and data analysis techniques.

📌 Project Overview

This project is based on Lesson 10 – SQL Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY) and focuses on analysing a South African residential property dataset using structured SQL queries.

The objective of this project was to strengthen my understanding of:

COUNT() aggregations

SUM() calculations

AVG() analysis

GROUP BY logic

Filtering grouped data

Translating business questions into SQL queries

The project contains 40 business-driven SQL questions, divided into structured sections to simulate real-world analytical tasks.

🎯 Project Objectives

Using only SQL queries, this project answers real estate business questions such as:

How many properties are listed per province?

What is the total property value per city?
